## 📖 Overview
This repository showcases a deep dive into **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** implemented from the ground up using **C++**. Developed during the **Information Technology Institute (ITI) 9-Month Program**, these projects emphasize manual memory management, pointer arithmetic, and the mathematical efficiency of code.

> **Challenge:** All structures were built without using the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) to master the underlying mechanics of data organization.

## 📂 Modules & Implementations

### 🌳 1. Binary Search Tree (BST)
A non-linear data structure implementation providing efficient search, insert, and delete operations.
- **Key Features:** Recursive and Iterative approaches, Node Deletion (handling 3 cases), Tree Depth calculation, and Parent/Max-Right tracking.
- **Concepts:** `Recursion`, `Tree Traversal (In-order)`, `Dynamic Memory Allocation`.

### 📊 2. Sorting & Searching Analysis
Algorithms applied to dynamic node-based structures to evaluate performance in non-contiguous memory.
- **Sorting:** Bubble Sort and Selection Sort implemented for Linked Lists.
- **Searching:** Linear Search and Binary Search (analyzed for List efficiency).
- **Deliverables:** Includes a detailed **Theoretical Report** comparing algorithm complexities ($O(n^2)$ vs $O(n \log n)$).

### 🔄 3. Circular Deque (Array-Based)
A Double-Ended Queue (Deque) using circular indexing to optimize fixed-size memory buffers.
- **Key Features:** `insertFront`, `deleteRear`, and circular logic to prevent "false overflows."
- **Concepts:** `Modulo Arithmetic`, `Circular Buffers`.

### 🔗 4. Doubly Linked List
The foundation of dynamic data storage.
- **Key Features:** Bi-directional traversal, mid-list insertions (`InsertAfter`/`InsertBefore`), and full memory cleanup in destructors.
- **Concepts:** `Pointers`, `Manual Memory Management`, `Node Linking`.

## 🛠 Technical Skills Matrix

### 🧠 Data Engineering
- **Manual Memory Management:** Expert use of `new` and `delete` to manage the heap and prevent memory leaks.
- **Complexity Analysis:** Proficient in **Big O Notation** to evaluate time and space trade-offs.
- **Pointer Manipulation:** Handling complex pointer-to-pointer logic and node rewiring.

### 💻 Algorithmic Mastery
- **Traversals:** In-order, Pre-order, and Post-order tree traversals.
- **Optimization:** Refined sorting passes and conditional checks for edge cases (empty structures, single nodes).
